# 🤖 30 Days of AI Agents

Welcome to my **30 Days of AI Agents** challenge!

---

## 🧠 What is this?

This is a 30-day learning and building journey where I explore everything about **AI agents** — from basic theory to building real-world, functional agents using **Python** and **n8n**.

Each day, I document what I learn in a separate `.md` file inside the `days/` folder.

---

## ❓ Why am I doing this?

- To deeply understand how modern AI agents work — from scratch.
- To gain hands-on experience with tools like **LangChain**, **Autogen**, **CrewAI**, and **n8n**.
- To build a solid reference for myself and the community.
- To stay consistent and accountable.

---

## 🚀 How it will help?

By the end of 30 days, I’ll have:
- A complete conceptual and practical foundation in AI Agents
- Multiple small projects built with Python and n8n
- A public log of my consistency and growth

---

📁 All daily notes are inside the `days/` folder.  
Stay tuned!


## Tools & Frameworks

- Python (LangChain, Autogen, CrewAI, OpenAI API, etc.)
- [n8n](https://n8n.io/) for visual low-code agents and automation
- LLMs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude)
- LangGraph, FAISS/Chroma, Streamlit, Flask, etc.

---

## Goals

- Master modern agent architectures
- Build functional, practical AI agents
- Create reusable resources for future reference
- Share learnings with the community
